command name : Sudo
sudo (Super User DO) command in Linux is generally used as a prefix of some command that only superuser are allowed to run. If you prefix “sudo” with any command, it will run that command with elevated privileges or in other words allow a user with proper permissions to execute a command as another user, such as the superuser. This is the equivalent of “run as administrator” option in Windows. The option of sudo lets us have multiple administrators. 
These users who can use the sudo command need to have an entry in the sudoers file located at “/etc/sudoers”. Remember that to edit or view the sudoers file you have to use sudo command. To edit the sudoers file it is recommended to use “visudo” command.
